<h3><strong>relevanced</strong> is a multithreaded C++ server providing efficient document similarity scoring and classification as a networked service.</h3>

<h3>Using the established <a href="/introduction/model">vector space model</a>, it helps you answer questions like:
</h3>

* How similar are these two documents?
* How similar is this new document to a collection of other documents?
* Which of several groups of documents is most like this new document?

<h3><strong>relevanced</strong> can process text in English, Italian, German, French, Spanish and Russian.  It is unicode-aware and uses UTF-8 for all internal string representations.
</h3>

<h3>It uses an out-of-core model retraining approach to handle massive document collections with limited memory.</h3>

<h3>Clients are available for <a href="/clients/python">Python</a>, <a href="/clients/jvm">Java</a>, <a href="/clients/javascript">Javascript</a> and <a href="/clients/ruby">Ruby</a>.

<h3>The server can be installed from a <a href="/installation/os-packages">DEB package</a> or run as a <a href="/installation/docker">Docker image</a>, or you can <a href="/installation/building-from-source">build it from source.</a></h3>
